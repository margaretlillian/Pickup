/* OVERVIEW OF APP */

This app will allow a person to schedule donation pickups and furniture deliveries digitally. The scheduler will be able to enter in donor/customer information, and retrive said information in the case of repeat donors/customers. This will be able to handle both scenarios where one donor/customer has multiple addresses (eg, realtors) and scenarios where one repeat donor/customer has only one address. 

I am making this app because where I work, this is currently done manually, and it is frustrating to ask repeat donors/customers to continually give their address, and also difficult to search for previous pickups/deliveries. 

/* SOME FEATURES OF APP */

Scheduler Login: Schedulers will login and get credit (or blame?) for each pickup or delivery they schedule. The app is only accessible to logged in users. 

Schedule Matrix: A weekly and monthly matrix will be populated automatically. This benefits schedulers in making scheduling pickups/deliveries easier. This also enables management and drivers to have a quick overview of each days' agenda. This also prevents double scheduling. 

Donor/Customer search: Scheduler will be able to search existing donors, customers, addresses etc. This speeds up the scheduling process for repeat donors.

Blacklist: There are unfortunately customers and donors who act aggressively or inappropriately. The blacklist will prevent the scheduler from inadvertently scheduling another pickup/delivery for such individuals.
